# Simple_VN

Simple_VN is a very simple Visual Novel Engine written in HTML.
The story is created using json.
The JSON script is contained at the bottom of the main.js file.
This allows the story to be mostly separated from the code and stored in such a way that it can be easily modified for later changes.
